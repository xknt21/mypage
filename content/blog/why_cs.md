Hi there👋🏻  
I hope you doing well.

Today, I would like to show you why I decided to study computer science.


## Childhood experience

My father is working as a system engineer.  
So I had a lot of opportunities to use computer since I was a child 💻

When I was in the first grade of elementary school, I bought my own computer and started to use it enthusiastically. Also, I often saw my father working up close, so I somehow thought that I want to work using a computer like him.


## Junior High School experience

In Junior High School, I was working on two things using a computer.

### 1. Studying Electrical and Electronic Information Engineering (EEIC)

There is a college near my house that specializes in EEIC, and students and alumni there offered classes for junior high school students. There I learned basic knowledge of circuits, etc., and then did a project to control a robot I had built myself using an Arduino.

* About Arduino
  * Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

*my robot!*

The robot is equipped with a distance measurement sensor and is programmed to turn around and avoid a crash when the distance between it and a wall reaches 10 cm.

### 2. Application development

I was also interested in app development and develop a random number generation app using Andriod Studio.

* About Android Studio
  * Android Studio is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development. More about details >> [click here](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro)

I chose the random number generation application because of the opportunity to use it in board games and other applications, and because I thought it would be relatively easy to develop.

I uploaded the application I created to the google play store, but it is now deleted because I did not update it for a long time.

I felt this experience was particularly difficult for me, especially the front-end part of the project. As a beginner, I had a lot of challenges because it requires not only knowledge but also good sensibility.


## High School experience

In high school, I became interested in the use of algorithms and data analysis using Python.　In high school, I became interested in the use of algorithms and data analysis using Python. Because I learned that it can solve a wide range of problems from familiar issues to social problems.

## Summary

In this way, I have learned about many different fields of study. By learning a wide range of subjects, I have learned what interests me and what activities I find enjoyable.

It was this experience that made me most interested in algorithms and data analysis. This is because it is easy to feel a sense of accomplishment in solving problems. I would like to continue to deepen my exploration of these fields at university, while being exposed to a wide range of fields.

Thanks for reading this far!  
See you in the next post!

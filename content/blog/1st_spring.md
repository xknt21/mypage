Hi thereüëãüèª  
Today, I would like to explain what I felt in the spring semester of my first year of Uni.

## What I'm honestly thinking now

To be honest, everything was a new experience for me, and I was confused a lot. 
* **English based classes**  
  I'm studying computer science completely in English based classes. As a Japanese person with no study abroad experience, it was not easy for me to understand the classes. However, by facing my own English ability, I have already realized that my vocabulary and conversation skills have improved since the beginning of my enrollment. Because I had many opportunities to talk with foreign students and professors, I was reminded that my environment is related to my ability to improve. I would like to continue to grow up my English in this wonderful environment.

*Academic English is difficult for me...*

* **Gap between Japanese and foreign educational methods**  
  I also felt that there are some differences between Japanese and foreign educational methods. For example, in Japan, it is necessary to memorize formulas and some values of trigonometric functions. However, in other countries, they can use a formula book or a calculator on the test. As another example, in Japan, almost all subjects are evaluated by test scores. In contrast, I have the impression that in foreign educational methods, students are often evaluated based on discussions and verbalization through essays.


## About the study content
I'm 1st year student now, so I'm learning basic knowledge about computer science.  
Here's my classes.
* Engineering Mathmatics... Differentation, Integration
* Information Systems Engineering... Shell, Network, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Experimentation... Theory and Hypothesis, Data Measurement, Descriptive statistics
* Programming Language... Python
* Object-orientation... OOA, OOD and UML, Java
* Physics... Kinematics, Dynamics of particles
* Academic English... Discussion, Presentation, Academic Writing

## Future goals and prospects
My goal is to be a data scientist using English. And I believe that this environment is the best way to achive this goal. My english skill is not enough yet, but do my very best for my dream.   

Thanks for reading this far!  
See you in the next post!
